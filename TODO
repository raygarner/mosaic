chord substitution program
	eg b5

extra argument to fb representing intervals

jazz lick generator
	eg notes from jazz minor scale half step above dominant chord root

do testing with alternate 7 note scale interval set
	eg modes of the jazz minor scale instead of major scale

cid
	make it so it can recognise triads with repeated notes eg
	    cn en gn cn en

dg
	read multiple tab inputs at once
	show nut for campfire chords
	make it work for infinite amount of chords
	make it optionally output just the note names so that it can be fed
	    into cid

fb
	show output from crd, mld, hrm

cf
	show output from crd, mld, hrm

mxml
	make it able to read output from mld
	make it able to read output from crd
	write key signatures

hrm:
	check for tritone intervals when adding middle line

crd
	be able to read altered extensions eg -9, +9, -5, +5
	be able to read input from crd
	be able to convert degree from diatonic to major, minor or dominant

program to show ted greene style chord diagrams

program to invert chords

program to extend chords

program to detect paralell fifths, paralell octaves etc

alternate style harmony generator
	try to simplify
	use randomness
	idea: linear time bassline generator in style of fugue.
		breaks melody into crotches and quavers
		creates 'call and response' texture
	fg (fugue generator)

standalone fb usage
write program to take unsorted musical data such as modes or chords and return it as a list sorted by 'tension' value of each item
flag to input notes via stdin for md
